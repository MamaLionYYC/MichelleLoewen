/* It looks like you have some CSS code that you want to modify. However, your question "how do i go to server" is a bit unclear. If you are asking how to deploy your website to a server, here are some general steps:

1. **Choose a Hosting Provider**: Select a hosting provider like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any other web hosting service.

2. **Upload Your Files**: Upload your HTML, CSS, and any other necessary files to the hosting provider. This usually involves creating a new project or repository and pushing your files to it.

3. **Configure Your Domain**: If you have a custom domain, configure it to point to your hosting provider.

4. **Deploy**: Follow the deployment instructions provided by your hosting provider. This might involve using a command-line tool, a web interface, or a version control system like Git.

If you need more specific instructions, please provide more details about your hosting environment or what exactly you are trying to achieve.
